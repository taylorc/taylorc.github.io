The document I started at 9am was still blank at 10am or I&#39;d read the same sentence over and over again or I&#39;d read the same sentence over and over again or I&#39;d read the same sentence over and over again or I&#39;d read the same sentence over and over again or I&#39;d read the same sentence over and over again....</p><p data-v-7ddafad0>Like a good technologist, I threw away everything working and replaced it with cloud-based technology. Unsurprisingly, that didn&#39;t work. Shock!

It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a Pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after Cirillo&#39;s tomato-shaped kitchen timer as a university student.</p><p data-v-7ddafad0>The next day I downloaded a simple Pomodoro timer on my phone and started my journey. Pomodoro has undoubtedly made me more productive. I&#39;ve discovered over time that it doesn&#39;t work for me for every task, but it works for writing, researching and reading tasks.</p><h3 id="apps" tabindex="-1" data-v-7ddafad0>Apps <a class="header-anchor" href="#apps" aria-hidden="true" data-v-7ddafad0>#</a></h3><p data-v-7ddafad0>After discovering that the Pomodoro technique worked for me, I cycled through a couple of Pomodoros and found the Android App <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-v-7ddafad0>Forest</a> which has an intriguing hook.</p><blockquote data-v-7ddafad0><p data-v-7ddafad0>&quot;Whenever you want to stay focused, plant a tree.
