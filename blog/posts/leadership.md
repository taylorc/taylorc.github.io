# What does leadership mean to me?

![Line of Lode Donation Bin](/blog/images/miner.jpg)

My family and I recently had the opportunity to visit Broken Hill in New South Wales while on holiday. Broken Hill is where the [Broken Hill Proprietary Company (BHP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill) was founded and is still an active mining community. The mining industry has a place in my own heart. My Grandfather passed away in 1959 when my Dad was 12. At the time, my Grandmother did not work and found it hard to get meaningful work around the northwest of England. My father, a talented footballer, had just been signed on schoolboy forms for Manchester United as a goalkeeper. He went on to play once for the reserve team, and his football career ended when he was 15 due to a knee injury. The benefits of being a footballer in those days were nothing like today. On signing the contract, he had to choose between staying in school or starting an apprenticeship. Given the financial situation his Mum and he found themselves in, he decided at the tender age of 12 to start training to become an Electrician. Every day he would travel on a bus to the local [Astley Green Colliery](https://www.nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/coal-mining-in-the-british-isles/lancashire-coalfield/bolton-bury-coalfield/astley-green-colliery-1908-1970/) and work in the mines as an Electrician. 

The image displayed above had a particular effect on me.

My Dad left Astley Green Colliery in 1960 to work at a local brewery until he married my Mum, where the lure of good wages took him back to work in the mines. This time at [Treeton Colliery](https://www.nmrs.org.uk/mines-map/coal-mining-in-the-british-isles/yorkshire-coalfield/sheffield/treeton/).

As the sun set over Broken Hill, that quote began to bounce around my thoughts like the baseball from the cooler scene in [The Great Escape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZa79QGDeo8). The more I dwelled on the passage, the more I realised the importance of the message for me. For many organisations, the most crucial thing they produce is not the widgets or services that drive financial value but the people that drive organisational value.
